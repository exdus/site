<p><span style="display: none;">The devil wants us to make shipwreck of our homes!</span></p><h1 class="bm"><span style="font-size: 36pt; color: #d88017; font-weight: bold;"> Escaping Shipwreck Of The Home</span></h1><p><em> By cody Francis  </em></p><p class="lead">This is a special tempatation to young people and, thus we need to clearly understand how we can avoid this,because a shipwrecked home can lead to the most unhappiness in this world and in many cases, to shipwreck of eternity.&nbsp;</p><p class="lead">Paul's shipwreck experience as recorded in Acts 27, has a great deal of information for us as we are studying this subject.</p><p class="lead">We read in this passage that the time for sailing had past. Consequently paul was admonishing the shipmaster that the voyage was going to be disastrous. He counseled him not to go, and he warned that a voyage would result in disaster, not only to the ship and cargo, but also to life.<br>But the captain did not listen.</p><p class="lead">After all , Paul was a prisoner trying to tell the captain what he should do. The chain of command doesn not generally work that way! Normally, prisoners do not tell captain's what to do, but Paul was a unique prisoner.</p><p class="lead">This prisoner, this messenger from God gave instruction not to sail, because doing so would result in a shipwreck. What happened, the captain ignored the messenger from God and sailed, and they were shipwrecked.</p><p class="lead">The same reasons for which the centurion rejected God's messenger are used today. The worldly counselors say it is a good thing to do, or it is more convenient or more comfortable to not follow what God's messenger has revealed to us.</p><p class="lead">Or they say that everybody is doing it so it cannot be that bad, but if everybody shipwrecks, do you want to shipwreck too? No, the only safety for us as young people to escape shipwreck in our home is to follow implicitly what God has revealed to us through His messenger's, through the bible, and through the spirit of prophecy.</p><p class="lead">Consider the following points as to when it is safe to enter into a relationship.</p><span style="color:#FF7519;">Know the creator</span><p class="lead">From Genesis 2:21, 22 we learn that, God first made Adam. God could have made Adam and Eve together; it would have no problem. He spoke, and all animals came forth; all the plants came forth; but He did not make Adam and Eve together.</p><p class="lead">Adam was made first so he could become acquianted with God. God wanted Adam to develop a relationship with Him first.</p><p class="lead">It is feasible that if God had made them both together, instead of developing a relationship with their creator, their eyes would have locked on each other, and then they would not have had that relationship with their creator.</p><p class="lead">Again God could have made Eve without putting Adam to sleep. He could have just formed the dust of the ground and breathed into Eve, and there Adam's mate would have been.<br>I believe that God put Adam to sleep so that Eve could develop a relationship with her creator  before she did with Adam.</p><p class="lead">We must, before we contemplate on earthly relationship, have a relationship with our creator.Any thing else is in danger of leading us to shipwreck in our homes,which frequently results in shipwreck of eternity.Both individuals need to have a relationship with their creator before they are prepared for a relationship with each other.</p><span style="color:#FF7519;">Life Work</span><p class="lead">Genesis 2: 15, 19, 20. This account is very instructive.Adam was created but he was not just introduced to his creator the given Eve. God first gave to Adam a way to live. He gave him his lifework before he gave him his life companion. We need to know and be prepared for our lifework before we enter into relationship.</p><span style="color:#FF7519;">Financial Responsibilty</span><p class="lead">From 1 Timothy 5:8 We learn that if we do not provide for our own, we have denied the faith and are worse than an infidel! So is it wise a very wise thing to get married if we have no way of supporting a family? </p><p class="lead">Financial stresses are ranked as one of the highest causes of divorce.<br>I am not saying we should own our business or have to own a house, but we need to have some way to support a family</p><span style="color:#FF7519;">Godly Counselors</span><p class="lead">A very difficult story for us in this day and age in which we live is given in Genesis 24. Abraham was arranging for the marriage of his 40-year old son Isaac.If we were 40,would we think that our parents would have the right to direct so intimately in our affairs? But Isaac trusted his fathers judgement.Isaac listened to godly counselors.Our parents, if they are in the lord are the best counselors we have.</p><p class="lead">Counselors are important because love is blind.It is very hard when someone counsels against what the heart wants. But we need to seek advice from godly counselors, even if we are 40 years old.</p><span style="color:#FF7519;">Poor Judge</span><p class="lead">God's messenger, Ellen White stated:"A youth not out of his teens is a poor judge of the fitness of a person as young as himself to be his companion for life." messeges to young people, 452.<br>As we grow and mature, we change. Many people, when they narry young start separating as they mature and change, resulting in a shipwrecked home. That is why the Lord gave us this counsel.</p><span style="color:#FF7519;">Allow God To Lead</span><p class="lead">"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh: she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man." Genesis 2:21-23.</p><p class="lead">Does it appear as though Adam was searching under every leaf in the garden to try to find a mate? No, Adam allowed God to lead. We must allow God to lead. It is not safe to enter into a relationship unless both persons involved know that God is leading. Adam and Eve knew that God was leading</p><span style="color:#FF7519;">Passed By</span><p class="lead">Oh but we may think that we are going to get passed by. God does not withhold any good thing from us, and the Lord promises that if we commit our ways to Him, He will give us the desires of our heart. (psalm 84:11; 37:4.) E.G White wrote "Marriage is something that will influence and affect your life both in this life and in the world to come. A sincere christian will not advance in this direction without knowing the knowledge that God approves his course. He will not want to choose fir himself, but will feel that God must choose for him." The adventist Home, 43.</p><p class="lead"> We need to come to that point of total and complete surrender and say , "Lord , i do not want to choose; that decision is too big for me." <br> When we come to that point of complete surrender, God can work, and God can lead.</p><p class="lead">May we each follow the principles God has given to us, that we might escape the shipwreck, that we might have a sure and solid anchor.</p>

Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind and spirit,dependent upon God for life and breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and the image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Christs' death however changed the narrative(Gen.1:26-28; 2:7, 15; 3; ps. 8:4-8; 51:5, 58:3; Jer.17:9; Acts 17:24-28; Rom. 5:12-17; 2 Cor.5:19,20; Eph.2:3; 1 Thess.5:23; 1 Jhn 3:4; 4:7,8,11,,20.)</p>
