<p><span style="display: none;">Jesus' Promised Gift</span></p><h1 class="bm"><span style="font-size: 36pt; color: #d88017; font-weight: bold;">Jesus' Promised Gift</span></h1><p><em> By Mark A Finley</em></p>
<p class="lead">The promise of the Holy Spirit is one of Jesus’ most
precious promises. It is the gift of His presence to
encourage, strengthen, revitalize, and empower each
believer. This precious gift is often misunderstood and quite
mysterious for too many Christians. In this month’s Bible
study we will explore the nature, function, and ministry of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<em>1 What statement did Jesus make to His disciples
about His departure? Read John 16:7 and meditate
on the significance of Jesus’ statement.</em>
<p class="lead">Jesus’ disciples must have been perplexed when He told
them that He was soon to leave. They were further amazed
when He stated that it was to their advantage that He go
away. What do you think He meant by that statement? Here
is one possibility: The disciples would soon be scattered.
They would witness of His love in villages, cities, and coun-
tries throughout the Mediterranean world. While He was
there in the flesh, He could be present in only one location.
But through the presence of His Holy Spirit, He could be
present with each one of them in their various locations.></p>
<em>2 Is the Holy Spirit is an influence from God, or
one of the members of the Godhead? Compare the
following passages: Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians
13:14; Ephesians 2:18.</em>
<p class="lead">Notice the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit: Each is described as members of the Godhead, coe-
ternal and coexistent.</p>
<em></em>>How does the Bible describe the functions of
the Holy Spirit as a divine personality? Read Gen-
esis 6:3; John 16:8, 12-14; Ephesians 4:30; 1 Thes-
salonians 5:19. List the terms that describe the Holy
Spirit’s personality.</em>
<p class="lead">According to Scripture, the Holy Spirit strives, convicts,
instructs, guides, and leads. He can be grieved and quenched.
None of these traits are possible for a mere influence. Ellen
White put it well when she wrote, “Evil had been accumulat-
ing for centuries and could only be restrained and resisted by
the mighty power of the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the
Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in
the fullness of divine power.”*</p>
<em>What terms did Jesus use to describe the Holy
Spirit, the third person of the Godhead? Compare
John 14:16, 17 with John 16:7.</em>
<p class="lead">Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as our helper or comforter.
These words come from the Greek word paraklete, which
means “one who comes alongside.” The Holy Spirit is the
personal presence of Christ who comes alongside each
believer to supply our deepest needs. It is a legal term. In
the Roman system of law a paraklete was an individual
assigned to meet the physical, mental, emotional, and legal
needs of one facing trial. The paraklete’s responsibility was
to be an advocate for individuals, representing them, stand-
ing by their side.</p>
<em>5 Read John 16:18. In discussing the ministry of the
Holy Spirit with His disciples, how did Jesus encour-
age His believers with the reality that although He
was leaving, He would still be present with them?</em>
<p></p>
<em>What is another function of the Holy Spirit
revealed by Jesus, and what specific gift does He
bring? Read John 14:25-27; 16:12, 13.</em>
<p class="lead">One of the ministries of the Holy Spirit is to teach believers
the truths of eternity. He does this by impressing divine
truths upon our minds as we study God’s Word. The Holy
Spirit also gives us peace in a troubled world, and brings
calmness to our hearts by giving us a sense that God is in
control of both this world and our lives.</p>
<em>How can we be filled with the Holy Spirit and
receive the third person of the Godhead into our lives
on a daily basis? Read John 14:13-16; Luke 11:13.</em>
<p class="lead">Our heavenly Father longs to give us the gift of His Spirit.
He desires the regenerating, revitalizing influence of the
Holy Spirit to flow into our lives. As we open our hearts to
Christ and desire to please Him in all things, asking in faith
for the gift of His Spirit, our lives will be filled with a sense
of His abundance, His peace, and His power.
So let’s ask.</p>

Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind and spirit,dependent upon God for life and breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and the image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Christs' death however changed the narrative (Gen.1:26-28; 2:7, 15; 3; ps. 8:4-8; 51:5, 58:3; Jer.17:9; Acts 17:24-28; Rom. 5:12-17; 2 Cor.5:19,20; Eph.2:3; 1 Thess.5:23; 1 Jhn 3:4; 4:7,8,11,,20.)</p>
