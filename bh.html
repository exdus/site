<p><span style="display: none;"> Moses’ life is a story of God’s miraculous leading and providential guidance. </span></p><h1 class="bm"><span style="font-size: 36pt; color: #d88017; font-weight: bold;">Moses God’s Friend</span></h1><p><em> By Mark A. Finley </em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="lead">Moses’ life is a story of God’s miraculous leading and providential guidance. Although Moses revealed character traits common to all humanity, his life demonstrates the glory of God’s forgiveness and power. Moses faced major obstacles, and the challenges he confronted could have overwhelmed him. But he looked beyond the problems and endured by faith because he saw “Him who is invisible” (Heb. 11:27).</p><p class="lead">Through the enormous challenges, obstacles, and difficulties Moses faced, he developed an intimate friendship with God. Near the end of the book of Exodus the record states, “So the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend” (Ex. 33:11). What could be more rewarding? To know God intimately and speak to Him as a friend is life’s highest joy. In this lesson we will review some of the events that shaped Moses’ life, and how he developed such a close friendship with God.</p><p class="lead">1 - What events at the time of Moses’ birth shaped His life? Read Exodus 1:7-12, 22.<br>Moses’ life was seriously impacted by Pharaoh’s decree that all Hebrew babies be destroyed. Yet God turned this curse into a blessing for Moses.</p><p class="lead">2 - How was Moses’ life miraculously preserved? And how was his future life affected? Discover the answer in Exodus 2:1-10.<br>Moses’ life was providentially preserved for a special purpose. Not only was he raised to the age of 12 by his own mother; she was paid from Pharaoh’s treasury to raise her own son. Moses was given the highest education in Egypt at Pharaoh’s expense. God has a way, even when there seems to be no way. God’s plans succeed in spite of humanity’s intervention.</p><p class="lead">3 - Read Exodus 2:11-15. What serious character flaw did Moses exhibit?<br>Moses believed, based on his background, education, and military training, that he was to deliver Israel from Egyptian bondage. He believed he was ready to accomplish something great, but God knew he was not ready. Moses had to learn lessons of humility, patience, and trust; so God sent him to herd sheep.</p><p class="lead">4 - Moses fled into the wilderness and ended up herding sheep for 40 years. He must have thought that God could no longer use him. How did God reveal Himself to Moses in the wilderness? Read Exodus 3:2-10.<br>Because of his earlier failures, Moses could easily have believed that God had forgotten him, that God could no longer use him. But God watched over Moses in his desert wanderings as a shepherd, and at the right time He revealed Himself. Moses was now ready to lead Israel out of Egyptian bondage and be the leader God wanted him to be.</p><p class="lead">5 - What was Moses’ response, and how did God answer Him? Read Exodus 3:10, 11; 14-17.<br>Forty years before, when Moses felt he was ready to deliver Israel, God knew he needed more preparation, so He sent Moses to herd sheep for 40 years. When God saw Moses had learned the necessary lessons, Moses felt he was not ready. God uses those who feel inadequate because they are ready to depend on Him. God uses those who sense their weakness, because He can be their strength.</p><p> class="lead"6 - Throughout the book of Exodus God revealed His miracle-working power. Read Exodus 4:1-4, 13, 14; 6:6, 7, and list three miracles God performed to demonstrate His mighty power to both Israel and the heathen nations nearby.</p><p class="lead">7 - What was God’s ultimate purpose in raising up Moses to lead Israel? Read Exodus 9:16.<br>God raised up Moses for the express purpose of revealing His glory to the world. God has raised up each one of us in our spheres of influence to reveal through our words and witness His glory. We too are to show God’s power in our lives to glorify His name, so that like Moses, we too can be friends of God and represent Him aright in everything we do.</p>
